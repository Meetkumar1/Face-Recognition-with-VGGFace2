# Face-Recognition-with-VGGFace2

Face Recognition has two main modes:

1) Face Identification -
In this mode, we map the input face against the database of many faces and give output as the probability likelihood of that input face belonging to the faces in the database.

2) Face Verification - 
In this mode, we compare the input face image with a known face image (i.e., image of an authorized user) and check whether they match. If Matched, the input face image is of an authorized user. If not matched then the input face image is of an Unauthorized user.

The VGGFace and VGGFace2 model are models developed for face recognition, and developed by researchers at the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford.
